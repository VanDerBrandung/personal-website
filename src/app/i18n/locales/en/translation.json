    "text3": "My coding journey started when I was 17 years old working on some very small projects in Java and C++. My business informatics degree enabled me to learn a lot about different areas of computer science. About that time I really fell in love with web development and began to spend a huge potion of me free time learning about Typescript, Node.js and React. In addition I was able to gather knowledge in the field of requirements engineering, data migrations and integrations during my practical semesters at DIGITALL. While still working at some medium sized projects with Java I mostly enjoyed working on the bigger web projects with Typescript.",
    "text4": "Today I’m working as a Consultant for Data Integration & Migration and with my remaining time as a lead developer at OneCalendar. I really enjoy both professions as they come with their very own challenges and at the same time I benefit from the cross-functionality."
