My business informatics degree enabled me to learn a lot about different areas of computer science. About that time I really fell in love with web development and began to spend a huge potion of me free time learning about Typescript, Node.js and React. In addition I was able to gather knowledge in the field of requirements engineering, data migrations and integrations during my practical semesters at DIGITALL. While still working at some medium sized projects with Java I mostly enjoyed working on the bigger web projects with Typescript.",
